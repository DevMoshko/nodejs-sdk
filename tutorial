1. Update your prismic configuration

- Edit the prismic-configuration.js file
-> go to your_repository_name.prismic.io/settings/apps and create a new Application
-> In this project, fill the corresponding fields in prismic-configuration.js
  - clientID
  - client Secret
  - Permanent Access Token (access to master)
  - Api Endpoint (your_repo_name.prismic.io/api)

- You can restart your node application, it's up and running !

2. Create your first Page

  2.1 Create your content

    - Start your tutorial in-app and come back here to complete the step 4.

  2.2 Create your first route

    - add a new Route in app.js

    app.route('/').get(function(req, res) {
      ...
    });

    - Query your content
      If you wanna create your homepage, make sure you have a custom type singleton with a published instance of it
      We are gonna query the content based on the custom type.
      You'll have to replace 'your_custom_type_name' by your singleton custom type name

      your code looks like this =>

        app.route('/').get(function(req, res) {
          req.getApi.then(function(api) {
            return api.getSingleton('your_custom_type_name');
          }).then(function(myPage) {
            res.render('index', {
              myPage: myPage
            });
          }).catch(function(err) {
            handleError(err, req, res);
          });
        });

  2.3 Create your first template

    - create a file `index.pug` in the "views" folder

    copy that code to import the layout and have a basic structure for this new page

    => Your template looks like this

      extends ./layout.pug

      block body
        div.content
          h1 Welcome aboard!


    - map your content

      Now you have to map your content from the document your retrieved in your controller.
      Don't forget, we sent the document content with the parameter named "myPage".
      If you change it in the index route, you'll have to change it in the template.
